A script to create python files with basic structure and permissions.
by atoivat  ~ github.com/atoivat

Put a name as first argument in the command line, and name.py will be created;
Otherwise, a automatic name will be generated based on time, and auto_name.py will be created.
The files always come with basic structure and permissions.
