# Python-Files-Creator-Script
A script to create python files with basic structure and permissions.
by atoivat  ~ github.com/atoivat

Put a name as first argument in the command line, and name.py will be created;
Otherwise, an automatic name will be generated based on time, and auto_name.py will be created.

Ex:
```./py.sh main``` creates ```main.py```.<br/>
```./py.sh``` creates an automatically named file.

The files always come with basic structure and permissions.
